## Abstract

Dyslexia is a neurologically based learning disorder affecting reading and writing skills. Traditional diagnostic methods are time-consuming and not always accessible. This study explores the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), particularly a fine-tuned VGG16 model, to detect dyslexia from handwriting images. The goal is to automate the diagnostic process and improve early intervention in under-resourced environments. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to validate the model’s performance.
